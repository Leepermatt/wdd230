        <p>This uses type face along with color contrast to display a visual
            hierarchy. It grabs the eye and
            quickly communicates the desired information. It also uses proximity to
            display Coke next to food to make you think the drink goes with a meal</p>

        <p>Nike.com uses Fitt's law very well. When the website loads your cursor is located right on a
            link to purchase the items that displayed. You don't even have to move the mouse to be able
            to click the link to taek you to their products. Fitt's law states that "that the time to
            move to a target depends on how big it is and on how far away it is".
